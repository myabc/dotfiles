Revision history for Perl extension HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK.

0.07  Fri Jan 25 18:13:06 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XA -n HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK

0.08 Mon Jan 28 11:47:00 2008
       - removed 'use 5.00.08' from Makefile.PL, causing the make to fail with
         earlier versions of Perl       

0.09 Tue Jan 29 07:56:41 2008	 
      - fixed image urls so that they retain size info, which would be lost after re-saving
        of files
      - removed superfluous runs of  <align left> tags followed by DokuWiki line breaks, as in:
           <align left>
	   </align>\\

0.10 Thu Jan 31 2008
        -Revised indent.php (in fckg/syntax) to compensate for what may be a bug in IE, where
         it does not recognize the color attribute of the <indent> tag, so that the middle dots
         are printed to the screen.  Now we use middle dots in DokuWikiFCK, but convert them to &nbsp;
         in indent.php for putput to the screen.  The &nbsp; are converted back to middle dots for
         saving to the DokuWiki file.

	-Removed Term::ReadLine from Makefile.PL, after Perl Tests on freebsd reported 
         failures. Used <STDIN> instead.

        -Removed empty <indent> tags during postprocess (DokuWikiFCK.pm)

        -Fixed image handling so that when image is fetched from root namespace a colon
         is prepended to the file name:  {{:root_image.gif}}
         Otherwise, when the image is accessed from a subdirectory of root, it is accessed
         as though the image is in the media directory for that subdirectory and so not found 

        -Fixed failure of FCKeditor fck_image.js to find namespace when openining DokuWiki
        mediamanager for uploading images.  Problem was with finding  'top' window.
        Added to fckeditor/fckconfig.js:
			FCK.getCurrentWikiNS = function () {
			 var ns = "";
			 if(top.getCurrentWikiNS) {
			     ns = top.getCurrentWikiNS();
			 }

			  return ns;
			}
         top.getCurrentWikiNS is output by fckg/helper.php into main.php and returns 
         the current namespace.  

0.12 Mon Feb 4 2008
	 -Fixed image handling so that external (and possibly internal) images (starting
	  with http://) are handled output correctly.
	 -Continued to work on indent feature.  There is a difference between FireFox and IE
	  in the handlng of &nbsp; characters in the FCKeditor.  I believe this is now fixed
	  so that &nbsp; characters in both browsers work the same.
	   
0.13 Sat Feb 9 2008
         -Added check-box to edit form to disable lock-timer by groups designated in Configuration Manager.
          The default setting is ANY (i.e. anyone has permission).  

0.15 Monday Feb 11 2008   
	-Added action/cache and re-worked syntax/indent.php. Addresses inconsistencies between
	 IE and Firefox in handling of space character (this is ongoing: see 0.10 and 0.12 above) 
        -Added DokuWiki header styles to fckeditor/editor/css/fck_editorarea.css

0.17 Thursday Feb 21 2008
        -Added plugin tool to FCK toolbar, which allows user to select syntax text for syntax 
         DokuWiki plugins so as to maintain their integrity -- keps them from disappearing, or
         getting corrupted, or having any text permanently written to the DokuWiki text file.
        -Added buttons which enable user to switch between DokuWiki Editor and FCKeditor and
         gives user choice of whether to backup the FCK file (with its exteneded syntax) and to
         start the DokuWiki editor with a clean file of the same name.
         -Fixed bug in _span_contents() which accidentally deleted the beginning of the text contents
          when more than one color tag was passed into the function's text node.
        -Cleaned up some syntactical issues in DokuWikiFCK.pm:
		1. additional code for the the _indent function, which now insures that
            the entire parentage of indent tags is searched for background colors. 
            This assists the FireFox FCKeditor problem where the indent characters
            sometimes print as '?' or middle dots to the screen.
	       2. code in postprocess_output() to removed duplicate unused indent tags
               3. similar code in _span to handle color tags   

0.18  Sunday Feb 24 2008
      - Restored <br /> pattern to indent.php, which is used for tables where a <td> has more
        than one line in cell.
      -  Now return empty string from _plugin(), where the plugin element is passed through without
         a syntax pattern between the tags.

     Monday Feb 25 2008
      - Added code to postprocess_output() to handle URL's that have not been set using the FCK
        toolbar item for URL's. 
      - In _span_contents(): added code to escape regex for $current_text and code to add $current_text
        back to $text string where no font or color attributes have been set. $current_text 
        is any font or color information already formatted into FCK syntax when the string is passed
        in to _span_contents(). 
      - Added new function _formats() to deal with bold, underline, ins, and italic formats. It cleans up
        formatted text, makes sure its valid, i.e. that what is being formatted is in fact
        text (not non-text characters), and eliminates duplicate formatting markup. 

     Tuesday Feb 26 2008
      - Added facility to convert FCK extended syntax to native DokuWiki Syntax.       

0.20  Tuesday April 8 2008
      There have been various undocumented changes made to DokuWikiFCK.pm to fix anomolies and
      irregularities in the translation of FCKeditor the extended markup.  The lock timer
      has been hidden from trhe user and is now automatically disabled.  There have been imporvements
      to image uploading and inserting from the FCK editor toolbar image tool. This includes
      an improved facility to create multliple userfile directories where there is more than
      one DW installation on a server. 

0.21 Thursday May 8 2008
     - Added facility for creating table header elements.  These are consistent with the standard
        DokWiki TH style.   

     Friday May 9 2008
     - Corrected Section 4 of README with respect to handling of path to /userfiles/ directory in
     situations where the userfiles directory is not found in the Document Root directory.
