Revision history for Perl extension Parse::RecDescent.

1.00  Mon Aug 11 13:17:13 1997

	- original version


1.01  Mon Sep  8 18:04:14 EST 1997

	- changed "quotemeta" to "quotemeta $_" in Text::Balanced
	  to workaround bug in Perl 5.002 and 5.003


1.10  Tue Sep 30 14:51:49 EST 1997

	- fixed fatal bug in tracing code

	- added m<delim>...<delim> format for regex tokens

	- added support for trailing modifiers (/.../gimsox) in regex tokens

	- added $thisline variable


1.20  Thu Oct  2 11:46:57 EST 1997

	- fixed handling of trailing regex modifiers (now no whitespace allowed
	  before between last delimiter and first modifier)

	- added trace diagnostic for failure/success of actions
	  (demystifies failures caused by an action returning undef)

	- added context for "Matched rule..." trace

        - added a test so that an integer value (N>1) in the
          $::RD_TRACE variable now truncates (to N characters) all
          contexts reported in any trace

	- added "start-up" actions: actions appearing before the first rule
          were previously an error. They are now executed (once) at
          the start of the parser's namespace.


1.21  Sat Oct  4 17:12:23 EST 1997

	- modified truncation of context in trace diagnostics (successful
	  matches now report first N/2 and last N/2 chars, instead of first N)

	- fixed incorrect version number in Balanced.pm


1.22  Tue Oct  7 11:53:27 EST 1997

	- fixed lurking trace problem with certain pathological regexes

	- fixed bug in generation of special namespaces (this was serious
	  as it prevented the use of more than one alternation in a parser,
	  as well as preventing the use of more than one parser in a script!


1.23  Fri Oct 17 10:15:22 EST 1997

	- fixed error message generation for <error?:msg> directives

	- fixed error message handling of empty productions

	- fixed handling of multi-line start-up actions

	- removed spurious debugging message for implicit subrule generation

	- changed naming scheme for alternations (pseudo-rule's name now
	  describes location of alternation exactly)

	- added support for repetition specifiers on alternations.

	- Text::Balanced::extract_.... altered to honour the context in
	  which they are called (see Balanced.pod for details).


1.24
	- fixed minor problem in tracing code (context string now correctly
	  reported for actions)

	- added explicit namespace declaration at beginning of generated
	  code, to ensure that any "start code" is declared in the
	  appropriate namespace.

	- fixed left recursion check on empty productions

	- added $::RD_AUTOSTUB flag and associated autostubbing behaviour
	  (see new section - "Autostubbing" - in RecDescent.pod)

	- eliminated hierarchical precedence between $::RD_HINT and 
          $::RD_TRACE. Enabling tracing now does _not_ automatically
          turn on hinting (although error and warning messages are
          still automatically enabled).

	- fixed bug in Text::Balanced. Division now correctly handled
	  in code blocks.


1.25  Mon Feb 09 12:19:14 EST 1998

	- Resynchronized numbering schemes for RecDescent and Balanced.


1.26 Wed Feb 25 13:52:15 EST 1998

	- Fixed bug (and inefficiency) in <resync:pattern> directive.

	- Improved checking of regexes within grammars 

	- Added subrule arguments (major change to internal grammar parser)

	- Added <matchrule:...> directive

	- started work on Compile() option (not complete yet - do not use!)

	- Made generated code "use strict"

	- Fixed bug which incorrectly warned against items
	  following a <error?> directive.

	- Improved $thisline (added assignment and resync)

	- Fixed expectation messages for subrules

	- Rearranged tar file to co-operate with CPAN.pm


1.30	Fri May 22 05:52:06 1998

	- Added <rulevar> directive

	- Added culling of productions starting with <reject> or <rulevar>

	- Cleaned up and improved format (and speed) of tracing code

	- Added warning levels

	- Optimized generation of token separator checking code.

	- Fixed bug encountered when parsing a literal string

	- Added $::RD_AUTOACTION to simplify standard actions at the
	  end of each production


1.31	Fri May 22 06:11:26 1998

	- Fixed bug in naming archive file


1.33	Fri May 22 06:15:26 1998


1.35	Wed Jun 24 09:57:02 1998

	- Removed "foreach my $var ( @list )" constructs,
	  which were biting users with perl 5.003 and earlier.

	- Fixed bug calling &Parse::RecDescent::toksepcode
	  instead of &Parse::RecDescent::Rule::toksepcode

	- Changed grammar so that colons in rule definitions
	  must appear on the same line as the rule name
	  (as documented). Added an explicit error message
	  when this is not the case.

	- Added $thiscolumn, which indicates the current 
	  column at any point in the parse.

	- Added $thisoffset, which indicates the absolute
	  position in the original text string at any
	  point in the parse.

	- Added $prevline and $prevcolumn, which indicate
	  line and column of the last char of the last
	  successfully matched item.

	- Added @itempos which provides:

		$itempos[$n]{offset}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{offset}{to}
		$itempos[$n]{line}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{line}{to}
		$itempos[$n]{column}{from}
		$itempos[$n]{column}{to}

	  corresponding to each $item[$n].
	  See new documentation.

	- Several trivial lexical changes to make xemacs happy


1.41	Mon Aug 10 14:52:53 1998

	- Enhanced POD in response to user feedback

	- Fixed subtle bug in Text::Balanced::extract_codeblock.
	  It only bit when '(?)' appeared in implicit subrules

	- Added ability to pass args to the start-rule.


1.42	????

	- Added a test.pl

	- Modified behaviour of repetitions, so that the results
          of repeated subrules which succeed but don't consume are
          preserved (at least up to the minimal number of repetitions)

	- Fixed bug: @itempos now not incorrectly reset if grammar
	  	     contained alternations

	- Fixed bug: Embedded unmatched '}' in regex tokens now works
		     correctly

	- Miscellaneous tweaks to RecDescent.pod (e.g. updated meta-grammar)


1.43	Sat Aug 15 06:43:46 1998

	- Resychronized Balanced.pm versions


1.50	Thu Aug 27 09:29:31 1998

	- Changed <rulevar:...> parser to use extract_codeblock, so as to
	  handle embedded '>' chars (e.g. <rulevar: $tmp = $self->{tmp}> )

	- Added <defer:...> to allow deferred actions which are
	  only executed if they are part of a rule that eventually succeeds.
	  (see the new section under "Directives" in RecDescent.pod)

	- Fixed matching interpolated literals (was broken when literal
	  contained pattern metacharacters)


1.51	Thu Aug 27 16:25:08 1998

	- Maintenance release, rectifying bad soft links in the 1.50 
	  distributions


1.60	Wed Oct 21 09:44:15 1998

	[Never released]

1.61	Wed Oct 21 11:06:19 1998

	- Added <token:...> directive for supporting (future) token-stream
	  parsing (see pod)

	- Added feature that data is consumed if passed as a reference
	  (see pod)

	- Fixed bug in autogenerated errors: now ignores directives

	- Modified behaviour of <defer> directive so that deferred
	  actions only executed if total parse succeeds (i.e. returns
	  a defined value)

	- Made error messages "anti-deferred". That is, only those
	  errors invoked in paths that eventually caused a parse
	  to fail are printed - see documentation.

	- Miscellaneous fixes for Text::Balanced subroutines

	- Made private namespaces inherit Parse::RecDescent namespace
	  (leads to more intuitive behaviour when calling methods
	   of $thisparser)

	- *** NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGE! ***
	  Changed the behaviour of token separator specification.
	  Now uses <skip:...> directive. See pod for new details.


1.62	Wed Dec  9 11:26:29 1998

	- Reinstated missing $prevoffset variable

	- Corrected a possible bug with autoactions (thanks Mitchell)

	- *** IMPORTANT CHANGE ***
          $::RD_WARN now initialized 3 by default. Serious but
          non-fatal errors are automatically reported, unless you
          explicitly undefine $::RD_WARN.

	- Fixed bug in AUTOLOADing non-method subs defined in
	  package Parse::RecDescent (thanks Mario)


1.63	Thu Mar 25 09:13:21 1999

	- Rewrote documentation to replace the concept of a
	  token separator with that of a token prefix. 

	- Fixed obscure bug in replacement of rules containing
	  implicit subrules (alternations). Thanks Craig.


1.64	Sun Mar 28 05:44:14 1999

	- Synchronized with Text::Balanced version

	- Fixed obscure bug in the treatment of escaped backslashes
	  in literal tokens. Thanks Matthew.



1.65	Wed May 19 12:35:05 1999

	- Added <leftop:...> and <rightop:...> directives

	- Added level 2 warning and autoreject for lone <error?>
	  directive in a production.


1.66	Fri Jul  2 13:35:06 1999

	- Improved error message when an action fails to parse
	  (Thanks Tuomas).

	- Allowed predefined subroutines in package Parse::RecDescent
	  to be used as rules in grammars

	- Changed error report on bad regexes to level 3 warning, since 
	  compile-time interpolation failure may falsely invalidate
	  regexes that would work at run-time.


1.70	Fri Oct  8 14:15:36 1999

	- Clarified use of "eofile" idiom in POD file
	  Clarified meaning of "free-form" in description of grammars
	  Fixed <resync> examples, which were invalidated by 
	  earlier change in semantics of <error>. (Thanks Knut).

	- Added grammar precompiler (see documentation)

	- Tweaked message for <reject> optimization.

	- Fixed bug when using '@' as a terminal (thanks Abigail)

	- Fixed nasty bug when $return set to zero

	- Added <score> and <autoscore> directives (see documentation)



1.77	Mon Nov 22 06:11:32 1999

	- IMPORTANT: Now requires 5.005 or better.

	- Added <perl_quotelike>, <perl_codeblock>, and <perl_variable>
	  directives (see documentation)

	- Added <autotree> directive (see documentation)

	- Added %item hash (see documentation - thanks Stef!)

	- Tweaked internal parser in line with changes to Text::Balanced

	- Added <nocheck> directive to switch off recursion checking and
	  other checks in stable grammars (see documentation).

	- Refined code generation WRT positional variables ($thisoffset, etc)

	- Added positional entries for %item (see documentation)

	- Fixed bug with (missing) start actions under precompiler (thanks Theo)


1.78	Mon Mar 20 12:03:17 2000

        - Fixed error messages and documentation for
          Parse::RecDescent::Precompile (thanks Jim)

        - Moved demos to /demo subdirectory

        - Added tutorial in /tutorial subdirectory

        - Added <autotree> directive

	- Added (s /sep/) notation (thanks Greg)

	- Circumvented \G and /gc calamities

        - Added more comprehensible error message when parser invoked
          through non-existent startrule (thanks Jeff)

	- Fixed serious bug with creating new parsers after existing
	  ones had failed. (Thanks Paul)

	- Fixed problem with nested implicit subrules (thanks Marc).


1.79	Mon Aug 21 11:27:39 2000

	- Pod tweak (thanks Abigail)

	- Documented need to use do{..} within some <reject:...>
	  directives (thanks Paul)

	- Added Save method

	- Fixed bug that was preventing precompiled parsers being 
	  subsequently extended (thanks Jeff).

	- Changed keys used by %item. Now uses "named positionals"
	  rather that simple positionals for non-subrule items
	  (see documentation)

	- Added trimmer for surrounding whitespace in matchrules.

	- Squelched bug in (not) handling invalid directives (thanks John)


1.80	Sat Jan 20 05:02:35 2001

	- Fixed Save so that saved parsers can still be used after saving
	  (thanks Supun)

	- Fixed bug in line number tracking (thanks Theo)

	- Fixed bug in (s /pat/) shorthand (thanks Julien)

	- Improved docs on <rulevar> (thanks Steve)


1.90	Tue Mar 25 01:17:38 2003


	- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The key of an %item entry for
	  a repeated subrule now includes the repetition specifier.
	  For example, in:

		sentence: subject verb word(s)

	  the various matched items will be stored in $item{'subject'},
	  $item{'verb'}, and $item{'word(s)'} (i.e. *not* in $item{'word'},
	  as it would have been in previous versions of the module).
	  (thanks Anthony)

	- Changed argument passing behaviour. If no arguments specified
	  for subrule, it is now passed current rule's @arg instead. To 
	  get old (no arguments) behaviour use: subrule[]

	- Fixed bug in <reject> handling: failed to reject if $return
	  had been set. (thanks Nick)

	- Added two useful demos of restructuring nested data (thanks Marc)

	- Fixed doc bug re use of // (thanks Randal)

	- Localized filehandles, like a good citizen should

	- Misc doc bug fixes (thanks all)

	- Fixed Text::Balance dependency in Makefile.PL (thanks Dominique)

	- Fixed bug that @itempos wasn't set up if referred to only in
	  an autoaction. (thanks Eric)

	- Fixed truncation bug in tracing contexts

	- Dramatically improved speed of line counting (thanks John)

	- Made item(s) and item(s /,/) behave consistently wrt %item
	  (thanks Marcel)

	- Added prototype <autorule:...> handling

	- Added outer block markers for <perl_codeblock>

	- Fixed multi-grammar precompilation (thanks Dominique)

	- Fixed numerous snafus in tutorial.html (thanks Ralph)

	- Added nesting level information to traces

	- Fixed resetting of $text after an <uncommit> rule.



1.91	Fri Mar 28 23:20:28 2003

	- Updated Text::Balanced to fix various bugs


1.92	Wed Apr  2 04:45:37 2003

	- Removed Text::Balanced from distribution (now a prereq only)


1.93	Wed Apr  2 22:25:14 2003

	- Fixed fatal error with $tracelevel (thanks everyone)


1.94	Wed Apr  9 08:29:33 2003

	- Replaced 'our' with 'use vars' to reinstate 5.005 compatibility.
