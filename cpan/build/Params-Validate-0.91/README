The Params::Validate module provides a flexible system for validation
method/function call parameters.  The validation can be as simple as
checking for the presence of required parameters or as complex as
validating object classes (via isa) or capabilities (via can),
checking parameter types, and using customized callbacks to ensure
data integrity.

The module has been designed to work equally well with positional or
named parameters (as a hash or hash reference).

It includes both a fast XS implementation, and a slower pure Perl
implementation that it can fall back on.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you do not have a C compiler on your machine, then the pure Perl
implementation will be installed.  If you have problems compiling the
C version, then run "perl Makefile.PL --pm" to specify that only the
pure Perl version should be tested and installed.
