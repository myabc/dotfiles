HTML::WikiConverter installation instructions
=============================================

HTML::WikiConverter is an HTML to wiki converter capable of converting
HTML source into a variety of wiki dialects. It's aimed at folks who
are converting vanilla HTML websites into wikis.

The HTML::WikiConverter module itself is an interface to its various
dialect modules (e.g. HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki). To install the
latest version of HTML::WikiConverter and all of its dialects, install
Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter from CPAN:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::HTMLWikiConverter'

For just the interface:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter'

Individual dialects can be installed separately, e.g.:

  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki'
  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::UseMod'
  % perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::WikiConverter::Oddmuse'

Installing by hand
==================

You may also obtain the source as a .tar.gz, in which case you can run
the following after unpacking:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make && make test && make install

The 'make install' step attempts to install the module and the
html2wiki utility into something like /usr or /usr/local, which
probably won't work unless you're an administrator. To work around
this, you may install into your own local directory like so:

  % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/myperl5
  % make && make test && make install
