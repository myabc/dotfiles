.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBFile::HomeDir\fR is a module for dealing with issues relating to the
location of directories that are \*(L"owned\*(R" by a user, primarily your user,
and to solve these issues consistently across a wide variety of
platforms.
.PP
Thus, a single \s-1API\s0 is presented that can find your resources on any
platform.
.PP
This module provides two main interfaces.
.PP
The first is a modern File::Spec\-style interface with a consistent
\&\s-1OO\s0 \s-1API\s0 and different implementation modules to support various
platforms. You are \fBstrongly\fR recommended to use this interface.
.PP
The second interface is for legacy support of the original 0.07 interface
that exported a \f(CW\*(C`home()\*(C'\fR function by default and tied the \f(CW\*(C`%~\*(C'\fR variable.
.PP
It is generally not recommended that you use this interface, but due to
back-compatibility reasons they will remain supported until at least 2010.
.PP
After this date, the \fIhome()\fR function will remain, but we will consider
deprecating the (namespace\-polluting) \f(CW\*(C`%~\*(C'\fR tied hash, to be removed by
2015 (maintaining the general Perl convention of a 10 year support period
for legacy APIs potentially or actually in common use).
.Sh "Platform Neutrality"
.IX Subsection "Platform Neutrality"
In the Unix world, many different types of data can be mixed together
in your home directory (although on some Unix platforms this is no longer
the case, particularly for \*(L"desktop\*(R"\-oriented platforms).
.PP
On some non-Unix platforms, seperate directories are allocated for
different types of data and have been for a long time.
.PP
When writing applications on top of \fBFile::HomeDir\fR, you should thus
always try to use the most specific method you can. User documents should
be saved in \f(CW\*(C`my_documents\*(C'\fR, data that supports an application but isn't
normally editing by the user directory should go into \f(CW\*(C`my_data\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On platforms that do not make any distinction, all these different
methods will harmlessly degrade to the main home directory, but on
platforms that care \fBFile::HomeDir\fR will always try to Do The Right
Thing(tm).
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
Two types of methods are provided. The \f(CW\*(C`my_method\*(C'\fR series of methods for
finding resources for the current user, and the \f(CW\*(C`users_method\*(C'\fR (read as
\&\*(L"user's method\*(R") series for finding resources for arbitrary users.
.PP
This split is necesary, as on most platforms it is \fBmuch\fR easier to find
information about the current user compared to other users, and indeed
on a number you cannot find out information such as \f(CW\*(C`users_desktop\*(C'\fR at
all, due to security restrictions.
.PP
All methods will double check (using a \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR test) that a directory
actually exists before returning it, so you may trust in the values
that are returned (subject to the usual caveats of race conditions of
directories being deleted at the moment between a directory being returned
and you using it).
.PP
However, because in some cases platforms may not support the concept of home
directories at all, any method may return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (both in scalar and list
context) to indicate that there is no matching directory on the system.
.PP
For example, most untrusted 'nobody'\-type users do not have a home
directory. So any modules that are used in a \s-1CGI\s0 application that
at some level of recursion use your code, will result in calls to
File::HomeDir returning undef, even for a basic \fIhome()\fR call.
.Sh "my_home"
.IX Subsection "my_home"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_home\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the main home/profile
directory for the current user.
.PP
If the distinction is important to you, the term \*(L"current\*(R" refers to the
real user, and not the effective user.
.PP
This is also the case for all of the other \*(L"my\*(R" methods.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a home directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_desktop"
.IX Subsection "my_desktop"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_desktop\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the \*(L"desktop\*(R"
directory for the current user.
.PP
Due to the diversity and complexity of implementions required to deal with
implementing the required functionality fully and completely, for the moment
\&\f(CW\*(C`my_desktop\*(C'\fR is \fBnot\fR going to be implemented.
.PP
That said, I am extremely interested in code to implement \f(CW\*(C`my_desktop\*(C'\fR on
Unix, as long as it is capable of dealing (as the Windows implementation
does) with internationalisation. It should also avoid false positive
results by making sure it only returns the appropriate directories for the
appropriate platforms.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a desktop directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_documents"
.IX Subsection "my_documents"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_documents\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the directory (for
the current user) where the user's documents are stored.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a documents directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_music"
.IX Subsection "my_music"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_music\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the directory
where the current user's music is stored.
.PP
No bias is made to any particular music type or music program, rather the
concept of a directory to hold the user's music is made at the level of the
underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_pictures"
.IX Subsection "my_pictures"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_pictures\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the directory
where the current user's pictures are stored.
.PP
No bias is made to any particular picture type or picture program, rather the
concept of a directory to hold the user's pictures is made at the level of the
underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_videos"
.IX Subsection "my_videos"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_videos\*(C'\fR method takes no arguments and returns the directory
where the current user's videos are stored.
.PP
No bias is made to any particular video type or video program, rather the
concept of a directory to hold the user's videos is made at the level of the
underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "my_data"
.IX Subsection "my_data"
The \f(CW\*(C`my_data\*(C'\fR takes no arguments and returns the directory where
local applications should stored their internal data for the current
user.
.PP
Generally an application would create a subdirectory such as \f(CW\*(C`.foo\*(C'\fR,
beneath this directory, and store its data there. By creating your
directory this way, you get an accurate result on the maximum number
of platforms.
.PP
For example, on Unix you get \f(CW\*(C`~/.foo\*(C'\fR and on Win32 you get
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/Local Settings/Application Data/.foo\*(C'\fR
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the current user
does not have a data directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "users_home"
.IX Subsection "users_home"
.Vb 1
\&  $home = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`users_home\*(C'\fR method takes a single param and is used to locate the
parent home/profile directory for an identified user on the system.
.PP
While most of the time this identifier would be some form of user name,
it is permitted to vary per-platform to support user ids or UUIDs as
applicable for that platform.
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if that user
does not have a home directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "users_documents"
.IX Subsection "users_documents"
.Vb 1
\&  $docs = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');
.Ve
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if that user
does not have a documents directory, or dies on error.
.Sh "users_data"
.IX Subsection "users_data"
.Vb 1
\&  $data = File::HomeDir->users_data('foo');
.Ve
.PP
Returns the directory path as a string, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if that user
does not have a data directory, or dies on error.
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"

\&  use File::HomeDir;
\&  $home = home();
\&  $home = home('foo');
\&  $home = File::HomeDir::home();
\&  $home = File::HomeDir::home('foo');
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`home\*(C'\fR function is exported by default and is provided for
compatibility with legacy applications. In new applications, you should
use the newer method-based interface above.
.PP
Returns the directory path to a named user's home/profile directory.
.PP
If provided no param, returns the directory path to the current user's
home/profile directory.
.SH "TIED INTERFACE"

.Vb 7
\&  $home = $~{""};
\&  $home = $~{undef};
\&  $home = $~{$user};
\&  $home = $~{username};
\&  print "... $~{''} ...";
\&  print "... $~{$user} ...";
\&  print "... $~{username} ...";
.Ve
.PP
This calls \f(CW\*(C`home($user)\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`home('username')\*(C'\fR \*(-- except that if you
ask for \f(CW$~{some_user}\fR and there is no such user, it will die.
.PP
Note that this is especially useful in double-quotish strings, like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&     print "Jojo's .newsrc is ", -s "$~{jojo}/.newsrc", "b long!\en";
\&      # (helpfully dies if there is no user 'jojo')
.Ve
.PP
If you want to avoid the fatal errors, first test the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`home('jojo')\*(C'\fR, which will return undef (instead of dying) in case of
there being no such user.
.PP
Note, however, that if the hash key is "\*(L" or undef (whether thru being
a literal \*(R"", or a scalar whose value is empty-string or undef), then
this returns zero-argument \f(CW\*(C`home()\*(C'\fR, i.e., your home directory:
.PP
Further, please note that because the %~ hash compulsorily modifies
a hash outside of it's namespace, and presents an overly simplistic
approach to home directories, it is likely to ultimately be removed.
.PP
The interface is currently expected to be formally deprecated from 2010
(but no earlier) and removed from 2015 (but no earlier). If very heavy
use is found in the wild, these plans may be pushed back.
